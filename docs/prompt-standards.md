# Prompt Standards

This repository ships prompts. The skills (`plugins/dev-workflow/skills/`), the slash
commands (`plugins/dev-workflow/commands/`), the hook's reminder messages
(`plugins/dev-workflow/hooks/codex-gate.sh`), and every template `/workflow-init`
writes are all prompt artifacts — they are the product, not documentation of it.

So this checklist is **this repo's own standard**, not only something it hands to
other projects: when authoring or changing any of the above, it must pass the
checklist below. `/workflow-init` scaffolds a copy of this file into each project it
initializes, where it plays the same role for that project's own prompts.

## Checklist (each item must be verifiably true)

1. **Target model named.** The prompt states which model executes it (Claude
   via Claude Code, or Codex via `mcp__codex__*`), and the author checked that
   model's current prompting page. Why: recommendations differ per model and
   change between generations.
2. **Success criteria explicit.** The prompt defines what "done" looks like in
   checkable terms (e.g. "typecheck exit 0", "story has ≥3 acceptance criteria"),
   never "make it good". Why: strong criteria let agents loop independently
   (CLAUDE.md §4).
3. **Stop conditions defined.** When to stop, escalate, or ask the user —
   especially for looping/agentic prompts. Why: prevents runaway loops and
   silent scope drift.
4. **Output format specified with an example.** Expected structure shown, not
   described. Why: examples constrain format better than prose.
5. **Structured sections.** Context → task → rules → output format, separated
   by headings or XML tags. Why: models parse delimited structure more
   reliably than flowing prose.
6. **Rules carry their why.** Each constraint states its reason in one clause.
   Why: models follow motivated rules better, and reviewers can judge whether
   the rule still applies.
7. **No contradictions with CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md.** New prompt text must not
   conflict with existing instructions; if it supersedes one, update the old
   text in the same change. Why: contradictory instructions degrade
   compliance unpredictably.
8. **Token-lean.** No duplicated content from AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md (reference
   instead), no boilerplate. Why: context budget is shared with the actual
   task.
9. **Positive instructions.** Say what to do, not what to avoid ("write
   flowing prose" instead of "don't use markdown"). Why: per Anthropic's best
   practices, positive framing steers current models more reliably.
10. **Calibrated emphasis.** Reserve MUST/CRITICAL/ALL-CAPS for genuinely hard
    rules; default to plain wording ("Use X when …"). Why: current models follow
    instructions more literally and overtrigger on aggressive language
    (documented in the best-practices page). Existing heavy emphasis (e.g. the
    CLAUDE.md §5 gate language this repo ships as a template) is a deliberate
    exception for discipline gates — new prompts need a stated reason to use it.

## Verified model-specific notes (read 2026-07-04 — re-verify per Revalidation)

Distilled from the model-specific pages; the linked pages are authoritative.

- **Less scaffolding on stronger models.** Skills/prompts written for prior
  models are often too prescriptive and degrade output quality on newer ones.
  On a model upgrade, test with instructions *removed* before adding more.
- **Review prompts: coverage first, filter later.** "Only report high-severity"
  makes current models silently drop real findings. The finding stage must ask for
  every issue with confidence + severity; ranking/filtering is a separate step.
  Gate B's Blocker/Major filter is downstream — the finding prompt itself must
  request full coverage.
- **Ground progress claims.** In long runs, instruct: audit each claim against
  a tool result before reporting; unverified work is reported as unverified.
  Belongs in executing/TDD prompts.
- **Fresh-context verifier subagents outperform self-critique** — independent
  confirmation of the cross-model gate design.
- **Never instruct "show your reasoning in the response".** Triggers a
  reasoning-extraction refusal on some current models; read structured thinking
  output instead.
- **Literal instruction following.** Current models don't generalize scope on
  their own — state it ("apply to every section, not just the first").

## Escalation

Recurring prompt-quality findings follow the same ladder as code findings: prose note
→ checklist item here → template change. Prompts are artifacts; `harden-finding`
treats them like code (rung `P`).

Note the reflexive case: a prompt-quality defect found in *this repo's* skills or
commands is a defect in the shipped product, and hardening it means changing the
plugin — which every downstream project then inherits on update.

## Revalidation

On a model generation change (new Claude model in Claude Code, new Codex model for
the gates): re-check this doc against the then-current model-specific pages, and
update the read-date above. The same rule is scaffolded into each project's
`todos.md` by `/workflow-init`.
