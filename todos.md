# Todos — dev-workflow-kit

Backlog of stories, follow-ups, and prerequisites referenced by
`docs/hardening-log.md` (`pending` rows point here by `ref`).

## Now

### Policy: the self-hosting milestone is closed (2026-07-18)

This repo now improves itself **reactively only**. A change starts because a finding
surfaced — through the gates, a PR bot, or real use — goes through
`dev-workflow:harden-finding`, and lands via the normal PR flow. There are no
proactive self-improvement sweeps: no auditing our own files looking for things to
harden, no pre-emptively broadening a checker, no tidying passes.

Everything parked below **stays parked** until its trigger condition fires or Daniel
explicitly pulls it. A parked item is not a to-do list to work down; several are
deliberately deferred trade-offs, and re-opening one without its trigger is the
anticipation-driven escalation the ladder exists to prevent.

Why this is written down: self-initialization is exactly the phase that generates
appetite for more self-work, and the ledger's own escalation rules assume changes are
driven by recurrence rather than by enthusiasm.

### Parked (trigger-gated)

- [ ] **jq-free parser stops at an escaped JSON quote.** A payload containing
      `echo \"quoted\" && git commit -m x` decodes to nothing, so no reminder fires —
      wrong direction under invariant 2, and only on machines without `jq`. Needs
      escape-aware decoding or a conservative raw-payload scan, plus tests for escaped
      quotes and backslashes.
- [ ] **Compound commands hash the pre-mutation tree.** `printf changed > tracked.txt
      && git commit -am x` is one PreToolUse event: the hook hashes before the mutation
      runs, so the commit carries content the hash never saw. Consider treating any
      command segment preceding `git commit` as uncertain and firing.
- [ ] **No regression test for a `git add`/`write-tree` failure inside the throwaway
      index.** codex-gate.test.sh now covers the "tree unavailable" guard for
      checksum, seed-copy, git-dir and `git diff` failures. Four seams stay untested:
      `mktemp -d`, the throwaway-index `git rm --cached`, `git add`, and `write-tree` — it needs a portable way to
      make those two calls fail on demand without breaking anything else the test
      relies on (a stub `git` earlier on `PATH` is one candidate).
- [ ] **Gate-B fingerprints disk; the reviewer reads history.** A review pass records a
      fingerprint of the index and worktree, but `mcp__codex__review` reads a **git
      range** — so content that is staged and never committed can be fingerprinted as
      reviewed without Codex having read it, and three such passes reach ✓. Raised at
      Gate A pass 8 of the index-tree story and deliberately deferred there: closing it
      means refusing to satisfy Gate B unless the index and worktree correspond to the
      reviewed range, i.e. mandating a WIP commit for every review. That redefines the
      gate rather than fixing a hash, so it needs its own story and its own decision.
      CLAUDE.md §5's WIP-commit flow is the current mitigation.
- [ ] **`check-invariants.sh` scans untracked scratch directories, so local scratch can
      fail it.** It greps the working tree recursively, not the tracked set, so a
      gitignored scratch file that merely *quotes* a violating pattern trips it. Hit for
      real: the SDD scratch under `.superpowers/` held pasted test output in which the
      word `npx` sat next to a `--yes` flag inside one of the checker's OWN test
      descriptions, and the checker then reported an unpinned-npx violation against a
      repo containing no such call. (This row deliberately does not quote that string
      verbatim — doing so put the pattern into a tracked file and made the checker fail
      on this very commit, which is the bug demonstrating itself.) A false positive, so it is the safe direction — but it is confusing,
      and it makes "the battery is green" depend on what else happens to be on disk.
      Surfaced by real use during the index-tree story, not by a gate. Fix would be to
      scan tracked files (or honour `.gitignore`), with a reject/accept fixture for a
      violating pattern inside an ignored path.
- [ ] **Temp-index writes land in the real object database.** `git add -A` against the
      throwaway index writes loose blobs/trees into the user's repo (verified: 3 → 5
      objects per review). Unreachable, so gc collects them, but a temporary
      `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY` with the real store as an alternate would avoid the churn.

## Next

Roadmap items below are **kit-side only** and carry the same trigger discipline as
Parked: each names the condition that starts it, and none starts early. Product-side
work — wiring a security battery, a validation lane, coded E2E — is deliberately absent.
That belongs in each product project's own `todos.md` once `/workflow-init` has run
there, not here: this repo ships the workflow, it does not hold another project's
backlog.

- [ ] **P2 + P6 — risk/security profiles, and security sections in the intake, spec and
      gate templates.** One story: the profile is what the sections key off, so shipping
      the sections without it just adds a heading nobody knows how to fill in.
      *Trigger: the first real intake in a product project* — the first time a story
      exists whose risk profile is a real answer rather than a guess about what product
      projects might need.
- [ ] **P5 light — stable AC-/SEC-IDs in the story and plan templates.** Identifiers
      that survive from story to plan to review, so an acceptance criterion can be cited
      instead of re-described. *Trigger: rides with P2* — the IDs exist to label what P2's
      sections produce, so landing them first would ship a numbering scheme with nothing
      to number.

- [ ] **Upstream-report candidate: `claude plugin update <bare-name>`.** The CLI docs
      document the bare plugin name as a valid argument for `install`/`uninstall`/`update`
      alike, but `claude plugin update dev-workflow` errors "Plugin 'dev-workflow' not
      found" on CLI 2.1.x while `dev-workflow@dev-workflow-kit` works. README documents
      the qualified form as a workaround; file via `/feedback` so the behaviour and the
      docs stop disagreeing.

## Someday

- [ ] **P1 — `workflow-status` → `workflow-next`, staged.** Report where a story stands
      first; only once that read is reliably right does it get to recommend the next
      step. Staged deliberately: a "next" that is wrong is worse than no command at all,
      because it is followed. *Trigger: 3–5 real stories completed in a product project*
      — fewer than that and the state machine would be modelled on this repo's own
      atypical usage.
- [ ] **P7 — `workflow-doctor`, extracted from the `/workflow-init` preflight.** Not a
      second implementation of the same checks: the point is a **single shared check
      source** that both the initializer and the doctor call, or the two drift and the
      doctor starts blessing setups init would reject. *Trigger: the next setup incident,
      or before the second project init* — whichever comes first; the second init is
      where a divergence would first cost someone real time.
- [ ] **P8 — passive metrics, read-only over the ledger and git.** Analysis only: no new
      state file, no instrumentation, nothing written back. It answers questions the
      ledger already contains the data for (which fingerprints recur, how often a rung
      holds). *Trigger: 10 stories or 20 ledger rows* — below that the sample says more
      about the last week than about the workflow.
- [ ] **`/capture-finding` as an intake extension of `harden-finding`.** An extension,
      not a sibling command: a finding captured outside the ladder is how a ledger
      quietly acquires two formats. *Trigger: the first production finding* — one that
      arrives from real use rather than from a gate or a bot.

## Tooling revalidation
- [ ] Re-check `docs/prompt-standards.md` against the current model-specific
      prompting pages on every model-generation change (new Claude model in Claude
      Code, new Codex model for the gates).
- [ ] **Escalation trigger for the invariant checker — read this before patching it.**
      The checker asserts only the spellings its fixtures cover. Adding one more regex
      arm per newly-discovered spelling is *not* the ladder working; it is the same
      rung applied repeatedly. **If a fifth unhandled spelling turns up in the wild,
      that is the recurrence**, and the answer is a real YAML/shell parse logged as the
      next rung — not another patch. Anticipating that today would be escalating
      without recurrence, which the ladder exists to prevent. Count so far: the
      spellings found during development were fixed as part of building the rung and
      do not count toward the five.
- [ ] **Invariant checker does not see Docker images outside a `docker://` action ref.**
      `FROM alpine:latest` in a Dockerfile and `docker run alpine` in a script are
      executable dependencies that invariant 5 covers, but every Docker rule is
      downstream of the action-ref scan, so neither is looked at. Raised by CodeRabbit on
      PR #2. Deferred rather than fixed there because it is a new surface (Dockerfiles,
      shell `docker run`), not a gap in a spelling the checker already claims — and
      the ledger ref is worded to claim only the latter. Needs its own reject/accept
      fixtures. Part of that story: `ci.yml`'s `koalaman/shellcheck:v0.11.0` is
      tag-pinned by luck, not by the gate — a tag can be repointed, so digest-pinning
      it belongs to whoever takes the Docker surface on.
